        "In this tutorial we established a connection to the [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service STAC Catalog](stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu_) and directly accessed an EOPF Zarr array with `Rarr`. We explored how to review the full Zarr store, read individual arrays, and gave an understanding of Zarr array chunking and dimensions. We also did a simple calculation and visualisation of NDVI using the `stars` package.\n",

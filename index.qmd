<h3> Your community guide for working with EOPF Sentinel Zarr data in the cloud </h3>

Explore EOPF 101, an open community resource designed to help Sentinel data users explore EOPF Sentinel Zarr data in the cloud. 
With our step-by-step and hands-on tutorials, you'll learn how to effectively use EOPF Sentinel Zarr products and build Earth Observation workflows that scale.

<h2> ðŸš€ Ready to explore EOPF 101? </h2>
EOPF 101 is designed for Sentinel data users who are new to cloud-optimised geospatial formats and cloud-based workflows.
It introduces you to fundamental cloud-native geospatial concepts, the Earth Observation Processing Framework (EOPF) activities by ESA, 
re-processed EOPF Sentinel Zarr data, as well as tools and libraries to work with EOPF Sentinel Zarr data in the cloud.

Across five chapters, EOPF 101 gradually introduces you to the EOPF Sentinel Zarr products, how you can search and access these, relevant tools and plugins to use EOPF Sentinel Zarr data in different working environments, as well as practical end-to-end application workflows highlighting the benefits of EOPF Sentinel Zarr data.

<h2>ðŸ“¢ How to get involved </h2>
EOPF 101 is an open community resource under active development. Our activities are designed to engage with Sentinel users and to gather feedback on EOPF Sentinel Zarr products. 
There are different ways you can get involved and engaged:

<h3> Join the EOPF Toolkit Notebook Competition </h3>
Get ready and participate in the EOPF Toolkik Notebook Competition! The competition will kick off in October 2025 and run till January 2026. It is your chance to get hands-on with EOPF Zarr products, get expert input and guidance and show the community the great work you do.

[Express your interest](https://thrivegeo.com/eopf-toolkit-competition/) today and do not miss any updates related to the notebook competition.

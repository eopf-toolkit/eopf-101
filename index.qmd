<h3> Your community guide for working with EOPF Sentinel Zarr data in the cloud </h3>

Explore EOPF 101, an open community resource designed to help Sentinel data users explore EOPF Sentinel Zarr data in the cloud. 
With our step-by-step and hands-on tutorials, you'll learn how to effectively use EOPF Sentinel Zarr products and build Earth Observation workflows that scale.

<h2> ðŸš€ Ready to explore EOPF 101? </h2>
EOPF 101 is designed for Sentinel data users who are new to cloud-optimised geospatial formats and cloud-based workflows.
It introduces you to fundamental cloud-native geospatial concepts, the Earth Observation Processing Framework (EOPF) activities by ESA, 
re-processed EOPF Sentinel Zarr data, as well as tools and libraries to work with EOPF Sentinel Zarr data in the cloud.

Across five chapters, EOPF 101 gradually introduces you to the EOPF Sentinel Zarr products, how you can search and access these, relevant tools and plugins to use EOPF Sentinel Zarr data in different working environments, as well as practical end-to-end application workflows highlighting the benefits of EOPF Sentinel Zarr data.

<h2>ðŸ’¡ How best to use EOPF 101 </h2>

You can use EOPF 101 as a reference online resource to get example code and workflows for working with Zarr data, the EOPF STAC Catalogue, and different libraries and plugins facilitating the use of EOPF Sentinel Zarr data. 
Beyond this browsable version, you can also set up the required environment to execute the notebooks. 

<h2>ðŸ“¢ How to get involved </h2>

EOPF 101 is an open community resource under active development. Our activities are designed to engage with **Sentinel users** and to gather feedback on **EOPF Sentinel Zarr** products. 
There are different ways you can get involved and engaged:

<h3> Join the EOPF Toolkit Notebook Competition </h3>

Get ready and participate in the EOPF Toolkit Notebook Competition! The competition will kick-off in October 2025 and run until January 2026. It is your chance to get hands-on with EOPF Zarr products, get expert input and guidance to show the community the great work can you do.

<h4>How to Participate?</h4>

<h5>Step 1: Launch & Registration</h5>

The competition officially begins with its launch at [Big Data from Space 2025](https://www.bigdatafromspace2025.org/) on 30 September 2025. During this stage, you will be able to register [your interest](https://thrivegeo.com/eopf-toolkit-competition/) to receive updates!<br>

<h5>Step 2: Learning & Development

Explore this resource and build your own notebook! The [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service JupyterLab](https://jupyterhub.user.eopf.eodc.eu/hub) will be your primary development environment.<br>
Once you access with your [CDSE](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) credentials, you will get the chance to choose the language you want to develop with!

<h5>Step 3: Notebook Submission</h5>

Submit your completed Jupyter Notebook via [GitHub](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit/community-notebook-competition/tree/main/submissions) once complete, between 1 November 2025 and 30 January 2026 (23:59 UTC+1). Stay tuned!

<h5>Judging & Evaluation</h5>

A panel of expert judges will evaluate each submission based on technical soundness, effective use of the EOPF Zarr data and plugins and educational quality.

<h5>Awards & Showcase</h5>

The competition culminates in an online awards showcase where winners and highly commended entries will be announced.<br>

The top notebooks will be featured in the **EOPF 101** as new case studies and you will be given the chance to be a co-author of a publication on **EOPF 101**. 

For futher details, please visit the [notebook competition repository](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit/community-notebook-competition)!

    "text": "What is the Earth Observation Processor Framework?\nThe Earth Observation Processor Framework (EOPF) is an initiative led by the European Space Agency (ESA) designed to modernise and harmonise data from the Copernicus Sentinel Missions.\nWith the upcoming Copernicus Expansion missions in 2028, the amount of data will significantly increase. EOPF is ESA’s solution to organise Sentinel data in a way that works seamlessly with modern cloud technology. This will make it easier to find, access, and process the information you need. The new approach provides user-friendly access, simplifies maintenance, and helps keep costs down, guaranteeing reliable access to Sentinel data in the long run.\nThe Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions are the first to be updated with this new system.",

    "section": "The EOPF Data Model",
    "text": "The EOPF Data Model\nThe EOPF data model has been defined by following a set of principles:\n\nOpen standards: Following common and community approved data standards ensure sustainability and user uptake.\nInteroperability: Harmonised with a clear and organised structure that describes the data itself.\nCloud optimisation: Designed for efficient access and handling in cloud environments.\nConversion flexibility: Providing tools to adjust the data for different applications.\n\nTo achieve this, there are the following key development areas under EOPF:\n\nEOPF product structure\nThe EOPF prodcut structure defines how information about the data is structured, stored, and connected. It contains the key details we need to know about a dataset, like when it was collected or its level of detail (the attributes). As part of the EOPF, ESA is actively working on a common data structure for Sentinel data products, with the aim to define a common meta-model that can be used nacross all Sentinel and other EO missions. This approach ensures that data from several missions is consistent. Thus, it is easier to combine, relate, and evaluate data from different missions.\n\n\n\nEOPF Product structure\n\n\nThe EOPF product structure contains of the following key parts:\n\nMeasurements: The actual sensor readings (like how much light is reflected or the temperature), at different levels of detail.\nQuality indicators: Details that help understand how reliable the measurements are.\nConditions: Information about the environment or technical aspects when the data was collected.\nAttributes: Global metadata, such as when it was acquired and the sensor’s orbit.\n\n\n\nMetadata Structure\nMetadata can be seen as data about data, which provides essential information to understand and use data effectively. Inside the Copernicus ecosystem, it allows us to uniquely identify each Sentinel product by detailing its technical and geographic coverage information. To make sure the new data system works well and avoids redundancy, the EOPF metadata structure will be organised into:\n\nDiscovery Metadata: Following the metadata structure defined by the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogue (STAC), which helps to keep things consistent across different missions.\nProcessing History Metadata: keeping a record of how the data has been processed.\nOther Metadata: Information like the status of the sensor and details about the satellite’s orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“Learn more about EOPF and STAC here.”\n\n\n\n\nEncoding Structure\nAn encoding structure can be seen as the specific method used to package and store data and its associated metadata in a digital format. Building on the consistent data structure and clear metadata, the new storage system must be capable of handling various aspects of current Sentinel data (such as manifest files and tile structures from the SAFE format) while remaining fully compatible with cloud environments.\nThis cloud-friendly architecture will enable instant access to data, efficient processing of massive amounts of data, and seamless integration with other datasets, allowing you to work with data from multiple missions more effectively.\nCurrently, there are different ways to store geospatial data in the cloud, such as: - Zarr - Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF (COG) - Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) with Cloud Adaptations - Apache Parquet (with GeoParquet Extension)\nESA chose .zarr as encoding format as it allows for efficient handling of data, like selecting specific areas and combining different datasets easily (for example, by dividing the data into smaller chunks). Learn more about the EOPF Zarr format here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLearn more about cloud-optimised geospatial data formats in the Cloud-Optimised Geospatial Data Formats Guide\n\n\n\n\nProcessor Development\nThe way Sentinel data is processed is being updated to take advantage of modern cloud computing. This will make the processing faster and more efficient, while ensuring the scientific quality and accuracy of the Sentinel data remains the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the EOPF processor framework, visit https://eopf.copernicus.eu/eopf/",

    "section": "Why do we need to cloud-optimise geospatial data formats?",
    "text": "Why do we need to cloud-optimise geospatial data formats?\nThe volume of EO data has grown exponentially in recent years. The Copernicus programme alone generates ~16TB daily from the Sentinel missions. Traditional file formats, like SAFE (where each file can be hundreds of megabytes), are optimised for efficient archiving and distributing data. This means that we often download the data from an entire overpass, even if we only need to access a small part of it, for example, if we want to do an analysis of the area of a single city over a decade.\nWith growing data volumes, this becomes a challenge. To picture the different nature of challenges we come across, let us compare a traditional local workflow with a cloud-based workflow:\n\nTraditional local workflow: When working locally, we download much more data than we need, and we are constrained by the compute and storage capacity of the local system. However, one big advantage is that data and compute are close together, meaning that there is not much delay.\nCloud-based workflow: A cloud environment offers solutions to limitations local workflows have. A cloud environment offers limitless storage and compute capacity. On the contrary, data storage, compute, and you the destination are far apart. There is an additional time for data to travel between the storage location, processing resources and us. This time is referred to as data latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nData latency refers to the time it takes for data to be transmitted or processed from cloud storage to your computer. In local workflows, data latency is minimal, whereas in cloud-based workflows, data latency needs to be optimised.\n\n\nLocal workflows are similar to placing an order at the nearby pizzeria. It is quick since the ‘data’ (pizza) is easily accessible, but we can only choose from what they have on hand and their menu. The local alternatives limit our options. On the other hand, cloud-based workflow offers almost limitless choices and access to a wide range of speciality ingredients or distinctive styles.  This makes it similar to being able to order a pizza from any pizzeria on the globe. While we might have more options to choose from, the time between order and delivery can become a challenge.\nThe overall goal with cloud-based workflows is to minimise data latency as much as possible. This is why traditional data formats need to be cloud-optimised.",

    "text": "2.1 Characteristics of cloud-optimised formats\nCloud-optimised formats are optimised to minimise data latency. By allowing for an efficient retrieval of smaller, specific chunks of information rather than downloading an entire file. Accessing a smaller data subset also reduces the costs associated with data transfer and data processing.\nCloud-optimised geospatial data formats have the following characteristics:\n\nData is accessible over an HTTP protocol.\nRead-Oriented, as it supports partial and parallel reads.\nData is organised in internal groupings (such as chunks, tiles, shards) for efficient subsetting, distributed processing and data access in memory.\nMetadata can be accessed in one read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen accessing data over the internet (e.g., cloud storage), latency is high compared to local storage, so it is preferable to fetch lots of data in fewer reads.",

    "section": "Cloud-Optimised Geospatial Raster Formats",
    "text": "Cloud-Optimised Geospatial Raster Formats\nInitiatives like the Cloud Native Geospatial Forum (CNG) help develop ways to use geospatial data efficiently in the cloud, using standard cloud technologies and encouraging open collaboration on data formats. Two of the most important formats for storing and accessing geospatial data efficiently are Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Zarr.\n\nCloud-optimised GeoTIFF (COG)\nCOGs are like snapshots of raster data (such as satellite images or elevation maps). This widely used format improves the standard GeoTIFF format by:\n\nOrganising data into tiles: Dividing the data into smaller, manageable squares (like 512x512 pixels).\nIncluding lower-resolution previews: Having pre-generated, less detailed versions of the data. This allows for fast and efficient data visualisations.\n\n\n\n\nCOG structure. Retrieved from CNG documentation\n\n\nA key feature is the Internal File Directory (IFD), which acts like an internal index. This allows for retrieving only the parts of the data needed using simple web requests. For example, it is possible to access just the tiles covering Paris from a large Sentinel-2 image of Europe.\n\n\nZarr\nThis format is designed for handling large, multi-dimensional datasets (often called “data cubes”). Zarr, developed and maintained by the community, works by:\n\nStoring data as compressed chunks in a flexible way.\nAllowing for efficient indexing and processing of the data in parallel.\nEnabling specific descriptions (metadata) for each part of the data.\n\n\n\n\nZarr structure. Retrieved from CNG documentation.\n\n\nFor example, Zarr makes it possible to extract temperature data for the summer of 2023 from a climate dataset spanning 50 years without needing to load the entire dataset.",

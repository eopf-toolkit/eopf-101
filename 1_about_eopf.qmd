## What is the Earth Observation Processor Framework?

The [Earth Observation Processor Framework](https://eopf.copernicus.eu/) (EOPF) is an initiative led by the European Space Agency (ESA) to modernise and harmonise data from the Copernicus Sentinel Data.

The Copernicus Expansion missions that start in 2028 will exponentially increase data volumes. As a result, **EOPF** aims to reengineer Sentinel data into a cloud-native, interoperable format for seamless access and processing. Long-term data usability, user-centered access, sustainable maintenance, and cost efficiency will ensure reliable access to Sentinel data.
Users will be able to retrieve specific subsets of data across missions and periods efficiently. This will support and facilitate analysis and integration with cloud platforms, fostering innovation in geospatial applications.
The [Sentinel-1](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1), [Sentinel-2](), and [Sentinel-3]() missions were chosen as the first to be reengineered.

## EOPF Data Model

The framework prioritises:

- **Open standards:** Compliance with Climate and Forecast conventions, enhancin accesibility to the general public.
- **Interoperability:** Harmonised structure with self-descriptive products.
- **Cloud optimisation:** Encoding for scalable access.
- **Conversion flexibility:** Tools to adapt data for diverse use cases.

To achieve this, ESA's roadmap defines four pillars:

### a) Meta Model

ESA's aim of harmonising Sentinel data products (as shown in Fig. 1) will result in a common meta-model that can be used not only across all multiple missions, but also on other Earth Observation (EO) datasets. This unified approach assures consistency while also allowing for mission-specific changes, making it easier to connect, process, and analyse data from multiple sources.

The structure is proposed as:

- **Measurements:** Sensor data (e.g., reflectance, temperature) at varying resolutions.
- **Quality indicators:** Metrics to validate measurements.
- **Conditions:** Environmental/technical context during data capture.
- **Attributes:** Global metadata (e.g., acquisition time, orbit details).

### b) Metadata Structure

Metadata powers the Copernicus ecosystem by uniquely identifying the Sentinel products and documenting their technical and spatial coverage. To assure the new models' interoperability and avoid redundancy, the metadata is composed of:

- Discovery Metadata: Focusing on the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs [STAC]() format, enabling harmonisation among missions.
- Processing History Metadata: Records of the processing steps.
- Other Metadata: sensor states, orbit parameters, etc.

*"STAC is a standard and a community of collaborators working to enable increased access to information about our planet. The focus of STAC is to make it as easy as possible for data providers to expose their data to the world."*

### c) Encoding Structure

Building on the standardised meta-model and metadata framework, the encoding structure must easily combine varied Sentinel data components manily the Standard Archive Format for Europe's (SAFE) format pieces such as manifest files, annotations, and tile structures while maintaining complete cloud compatibility. 
This cloud-optimised design allows rapid data access, scalable processing, and seamless interoperability, allowing users to collect, analyse, and integrate many mission datasets with minimal overhead.

At present, different types of encoding structures are available to embed geoinformation in a cloud-native environment. Some examples are:

- Zarr
- Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF (COG)
- Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) with Cloud Adaptations
- Apache Parquet (with GeoParquet Extension)


The encoding structure chosen by ESA should achieve the following aims:

- Preserves legacy SAFE format components (e.g., manifest files, annotations).
- Enables efficient scaling, subsetting, and integration (e.g., via chunked storage).

### d) Processor Development

Copernicus Space Component (CSC) Data Processors' re-engineering aims to leverage modern cloud computing infrastructure to enhance scalability and processing efficiency, while maintaining the scientific quality and accuracy of the original Sentinel algorithms.

## What's next?

During the following chapters, we will introduce and explain the structure of the EOPF products, elaborate into why the encodings were defined by ESA and allow you to familiarise the new EOPF data format!

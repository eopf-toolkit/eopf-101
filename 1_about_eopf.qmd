## What is the Earth Observation Processor Framework? {.unnumbered}

The [Earth Observation Processor Framework](https://eopf.copernicus.eu/) (EOPF) is an initiative led by the European Space Agency (ESA) designed to modernise and harmonise data from the Copernicus Sentinel Missions.

With the upcoming Copernicus Expansion missions in 2028, the amount of data will increase from the current ~16TB daily to an estimated 40TB+ per day. EOPF is ESA's solution to organize Sentinel data in a way that works seamlessly with modern cloud technology. This will make it easier to find, access, and process the information you need. The new approach provides user-friendly access, simplifies maintenance, and helps keep costs down, guaranteeing reliable access to Sentinel data in the long run.

The [Sentinel-1](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1), [Sentinel-2](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2), and [Sentinel-3](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3) missions are the first to be updated with this new system.

## The EOPF Data Model {.unnumbered}

The EOPF data model has been defined by following a set of principles:

- **Open standards:** Following common and community approved data standards ensure sustainability and user uptake.
- **Interoperability:** Harmonised with a clear and organised structure that describes the data itself.
- **Cloud optimisation:** Designed for efficient access and handling in cloud environments.
- **Conversion flexibility:** Providing tools to adjust the data for different applications.

To achieve this, there are the following key development areas under EOPF:

### EOPF product structure {.unnumbered}

The EOPF product structure defines how information about the data is structured, stored, and connected. It contains the key details we need to know about a dataset, like when it was collected or its level of detail (the attributes). 
As part of the EOPF, ESA is actively working on a common data structure for Sentinel data products, with the aim to define a common meta-model that can be used across all Sentinel and other EO missions. This approach ensures that data from several missions is consistent. Thus, it is easier to combine, relate, and evaluate data from different missions.

![EOPF Product structure](img/product_structure.png){fig-align="center"}

The EOPF product structure consists of the following key components:

| Component | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Measurements** | Primary sensor data | - S1: Radar backscatter<br>- S2: Surface reflectance<br>- S3: Sea surface temperature |
| **Quality indicators** | Data quality metrics | - Cloud coverage percentage<br>- Signal-to-noise ratio<br>- Data completeness flags |
| **Conditions** | Acquisition context | - Solar/viewing angles<br>- Atmospheric conditions<br>- Instrument settings |
| **Attributes** | Global metadata | - Acquisition time<br>- Orbit number<br>- Processing baseline<br>- Geographic coverage |

### Metadata Structure {.unnumbered}

Metadata can be seen as data about data, that provides essential information to understand and use data effectively. 
Inside the Copernicus ecosystem, it allows us to uniquely identify each Sentinel product by detailing its technical and geographic coverage information. To make sure the new data system works well and avoids redundancy, the EOPF metadata structure will be organised into three main categories:

1. **Discovery Metadata (STAC)**

Following the metadata structure defined by the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogue ([STAC](https://stacspec.org/en/)) which helps to keep things consistent across different missions.

```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "stac_version": "1.0.0",
  "id": "S2A_MSIL2A_20230615T105031_N0509",
  "bbox": [11.0, 45.0, 12.0, 46.0],
  "properties": {
    "datetime": "2023-06-15T10:50:31Z",
    "platform": "sentinel-2a",
    "instruments": ["msi"],
    "eopf:processing_baseline": "05.09",
    "eopf:product_type": "L2A"
  }
}
```

2. **Processing History Metadata**

- Original SAFE product ID
- Processing steps applied
- Algorithm versions
- Calibration data used

3. **Other Metadata**
   
- Instrument health indicators
- Orbit parameters
- Geographic coverage details
- Quality assessment results

### Encoding Structure {.unnumbered}

An encoding structure can be seen as the specific method used to package and store data and its associated metadata in a digital format.
Building on the consistent data structure and clear metadata, the new storage system must be capable of handling various aspects of current Sentinel data (such as manifest files and tile structures from the SAFE format) while remaining fully compatible with cloud environments.

This cloud-friendly architecture will enable instant access to data, efficient processing of massive amounts of data, and seamless integration with other datasets, allowing you to work with data from multiple missions more effectively.

Currently, there are different ways to store geospatial data in the cloud, such as:
- Zarr
- Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF (COG)
- Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) with Cloud Adaptations
- Apache Parquet (with GeoParquet Extension)

ESA chose `Zarr` as encoding format for its key advantages:

- Efficient parallel data access through flexible chunking
- Superior compression ratios (up to 5x better than traditional formats)
- Native cloud storage integration with minimal latency
- Support for arbitrary N-dimensional arrays
- Built-in versioning and metadata handling

Learn more about the EOPF Zarr format in the [EOPF Zarr Documentation](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/).

### Processor Development {.unnumbered}

The way Sentinel data is processed is being updated to take advantage of modern cloud computing. This will make the processing faster and more efficient, while ensuring the scientific quality and accuracy of the Sentinel data remains the same.

The ESA Copernicus Earth Observation Processor Framework proposed using **Zarr** as the encoding format for the EOPF catalogue.. Think of it as a well-structured container for all the information. The format's structure will be described in more detail in the chapter **What is Zarr?**.

An overview of the groups included 

| Group | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| **Measurements** | Main retrieved variables |
| **Conditions** | Measurement context (geometric angles, meteorological/instrumental data) |
| **Quality** | Flags and quality information for measurement filtering |
| **Metadata** | Attributes for the compression definition |

It is important to highlight that some product versions are not yet supported by the ongoing developments, mainly due to the continuous evolution of legacy SAFE/SEN3 products.

## Sentinel-1
The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission uses two satellites that work together. Each satellite has a special radar that can take pictures of the Earth's surface no matter the weather or if it is day or night. This ensures we always have a steady stream of images.

### Available product Levels

### Level 1
These are the first processed versions of the raw data.

Single Look Complex (SLC)
SLC images show the Earth's surface as seen by the satellite's radar. Each point has a complex value, giving both the strength and the phase of the signal. The amount of detail depends on how the data was collected.

Ground Range Detected (GRD)
GRD products are radar images that have been processed to look like they are viewed from directly above. They have been adjusted for the Earth's shape, and each point represents the signal strength. Some fine details (phase) are lost in this process, but the image has less 'speckling' and a more regular shape.

Until now, the ESA, along with the EOPF project, have decided to launch samples for the Level 1, which encopass the following structure:

## Sentinel-2
The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission uses two synchronised satellites flying together. Each satellite has a special camera that takes very detailed colour pictures of the land and plants. This camera captures light in 13 different colours, giving us a new way to see our Earth. The satellites are designed to cover a wide area with each pass.

Sentinel-2 gives us detailed colour images of the land. It captures light in different colours (bands) and at different resolutions(detail levels):

| Resolution | Bands |
|------------|-------|
| 10m | B2, B3, B4, B8 |
| 20m | B5, B6, B7, B8a, B11, B12 |
| 60m | B1, B9, B10 |

Spatial Chunking
For the compression envisioned, the tiles for each image are divided into blocks of 256x256 pixels. This is done in a way that aligns with the different resolutions of the colour bands, making it efficient to access different levels of detail. Each image covers a wide area of 290km.

The chunking strategies will be deeply explored in **Chapter 2**

### Available product Levels

### Level 2A

Provides atmospherically corrected Surface Reflectance (SR) images, derived from the associated Level-1C products.
These products have been further processed to display surface reflection while adjusting for atmospheric factors (such as air and clouds). Along with surface reflection data for various hues, it is possible to aquire products such as:
- Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT)
- Water Vapour (WV)
- Scene Classification (SCL) map.

These image products, as well as the Surface Reflectance for the different spectral bands, are resampled at different spatial resolutions.
Until now, the ESA, along with the EOPF project, have decided to launch samples for the Level 2A, which encopass the following structure:

## Sentinel-3

Sentinel-3 is a mission that regularly measures our Earth's oceans, land, rivers, lakes, ice on land, sea ice, and the atmosphere. Its goal is to keep track of and help us understand how these large parts of our planet change over long periods.

### Instrument Suite

| Instrument | Name | Measurements | Resolution |
|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| **OLCI** |Ocean and Land Colour Instrumen |t Ocean/land color (21 bands) | 300m/1.2km |
| **SLSTR** |Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer | Surface temperature (9 channels) | 500m/1km |
| **SRAL** | Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter | Sea surface topography | Variable |
| **SYN** | Synergy | Synergistic products from OLCI and SLSTR | N/A |

### Available product Levels

### Level-2 

These products process particular information that is helpful for various applications using the Level-1 data.  In terms of OLCI, this incorporates factors like the ocean's chlorophyll content and the land surface's reflectivity while accounting for the atmosphere.  Sea and land surface temperatures with quality checks are provided by SLSTR.  SRAL offers sophisticated ocean data, such as wind speed and wave height.  The SYN product analyses the atmosphere by combining information from SLSTR and OLCI.

#### Precise Orbit Data

Information about the satellite's position is available at different times after the data is collected:

- **NRT**: Near Real-Time (GPS-based)
- **STC**: Short Time-Critical (1-day latency)
- **NTC**: Non-Time-Critical (post-processed)

In the following chapter, the `zarr` specific structure for each of the products will be explored, allowing us to understand better, how to integrate the new format to Eart Observation aplications of our interest.

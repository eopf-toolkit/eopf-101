The ESA Copernicus Earth Observation Processor Framework uses **Zarr** as the encoding format for the EOPF catalogue. The chapter [About Zarr]() gives you a practical introduction to the sample data being made available as part of the EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service.

The main groups of the Zarr encoding are:

| Group | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| **Measurements** | Main retrieved variables |
| **Conditions** | Measurement context (geometric angles, meteorological/instrumental data) |
| **Quality** | Flags and quality information for measurement filtering |
| **Metadata** | Attributes for the compression definition |

::: {.callout-important}
Note: the re-processing from the legacy SAFE/SEN3  format to Zarr is an ongoing activity as part of the [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/). This page will continuously be updated as soon as new data products are available.

## Sentinel-1 {.unnumbered}
Sentinel-1 is radar imaging mission is composed of a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites providing continuous all-weather, day and night imagery.

### Available product Levels

### Level 1
These are the first processed versions of the raw data.

Single Look Complex (SLC)
SLC images show the Earth's surface as seen by the satellite's radar. Each point has a complex value, giving both the strength and the phase of the signal. The amount of detail depends on how the data was collected.

Ground Range Detected (GRD)
GRD products are radar images that have been processed to look like they are viewed from directly above. They have been adjusted for the Earth's shape, and each point represents the signal strength. Some fine details (phase) are lost in this process, but the image has less 'speckling' and a more regular shape.

ESA is currently updating this product. A more detailed structure of this product is available at the [EOPF Sentinel-1 Product Documentation](https://s1.pages.eopf.copernicus.eu/s1-l12-rp/main/pfs/index.html)

## Sentinel-2
Sentinel-2 acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolution (10m to 60m) over land and coastal waters. The mission supports applications such as agricultural monitoring, emergency management, land cover classifications, and water quality. Sentinel-2 imagery have 12 spectral bands with the following resolutions:

| Resolution | Bands |
|------------|-------|
| 10m | B2, B3, B4, B8 |
| 20m | B5, B6, B7, B8a, B11, B12 |
| 60m | B1, B9, B10 |


### Available product Levels

### Level 2A

Level 2A images are atmospherically corrected Surface Reflectance (SR) images, derived from the associated Level-1C products.
These products have been further processed to display surface reflection while adjusting for atmospheric factors (such as air and clouds).

These image products, as well as the Surface Reflectance for the different spectral bands, are resampled at different spatial resolutions.
Until now, the ESA, along with the EOPF project, have decided to launch samples for the Level 2A, which encopass the following structure:

## Sentinel-3

Sentinel-3 is a mission that regularly measures our Earth's oceans, land, rivers, lakes, ice on land, sea ice, and the atmosphere. Its goal is to keep track of and help us understand how these large parts of our planet change over long periods.

### Instrument Suite

| Instrument | Name | Measurements | Resolution |
|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| **OLCI** |Ocean and Land Colour Instrumen |t Ocean/land color (21 bands) | 300m/1.2km |
| **SLSTR** |Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer | Surface temperature (9 channels) | 500m/1km |
| **SRAL** | Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter | Sea surface topography | Variable |
| **SYN** | Synergy | Synergistic products from OLCI and SLSTR | N/A |

### Available product Levels

### Level-2 

These products process particular information that is helpful for various applications using the Level-1 data. In terms of OLCI, this incorporates factors like the ocean's chlorophyll content and the land surface's reflectivity while accounting for the atmosphere. Sea and land surface temperatures with quality checks are provided by SLSTR. SRAL offers sophisticated ocean data, such as wind speed and wave height. The SYN product analyses the atmosphere by combining information from SLSTR and OLCI.

#### Precise Orbit Data

Information about the satellite's position is available at different times after the data is collected:

- **NRT**: Near Real-Time (GPS-based)
- **STC**: Short Time-Critical (1-day latency)
- **NTC**: Non-Time-Critical (post-processed)

In the following chapter, the `zarr` specific structure for each of the products will be explored, allowing us to understand better, how to integrate the new format into Earth Observation workflows.

The ESA Copernicus **Earth Observation Processor Framework** has made available assets as part of the Sentinel processor re-engineering in the [EOPF Sentinel Sample Service](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/?.language=en). There, it is possible to explore different data sets in a Cloud Optimised format.<br>
So far, the missions integrated inside the catalogue are the Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3.
Each of them makes available to the public several Processing Levels (from raw info to composites) from which we can choose the data set that best suits our analysis needs.

::: {.callout-important}
The re-processing from the Sentinel Missions is an ongoing activity as part of the [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/). This page and our tutorials will continuously be updated as soon as new data products are available.

An overview of the available data sets and the information they contain for each of the missions is explained in this document.

# Available product Levels {.unnumbered}

## Sentinel-1 {.unnumbered}
Sentinel-1 is a radar imaging mission that is composed of a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites providing continuous all-weather, day and night imagery.

| Product | Instrument | Description | Available at |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Level-1 GRD| Ground Range Detected | The Sentinel-1 Level-1 GDR products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using the Earth ellipsoid model WGS84. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l1-grd?.language=en) |
| Level-1 SLC | Single Look Complex ( | The Sentinel-1 Level-1 SLC products consist of focused SAR data, geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite, and provided in slant-range geometry. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l1-slc?.language=en) |
| Level-2 OCN | Ocean | The Sentinel-1 Level-2 OCN products for wind, wave and currents applications may contain the following geophysical components derived from the SAR data: Ocean Wind field (OWI), Ocean Swell spectra (OSW), Surface Radial Velocity (RVL). | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l2-ocn?.language=en) |


## Sentinel-2 {.unnumbered}
Sentinel-2 acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolution (10m to 60m) over land and coastal waters. The mission supports applications such as agricultural monitoring, emergency management, land cover classifications, and water quality.

| Product | Instrument | Description | Available at |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Level-1C | Multi-Spectral Instrument | The Sentinel-2 Level-1C product is composed of 110x110 km2 tiles (ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection). Earth is subdivided on a predefined set of tiles, defined in UTM/WGS84 projection and using a 100 km step. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-2-l1c) |
| Level-2A | Multi-Spectral Instrument | The Sentinel-2 Level-2A Collection 1 product provides orthorectified Surface Reflectance (Bottom-Of-Atmosphere: BOA), with sub-pixel multispectral and multitemporal registration accuracy. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-2-l2a) |

## Sentinel-3 {.unnumbered}

Sentinel-3 is a mission that regularly measures our Earth's oceans, land, rivers, lakes, ice on land, sea ice, and the atmosphere. Its goal is to keep track of and help us understand how these large parts of our planet change over long periods.

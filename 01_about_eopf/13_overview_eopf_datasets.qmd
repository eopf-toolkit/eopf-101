### Introduction

In the previous section, we introduced the **Earth Observation Processing Framework** (EOPF) initiative and explored the advantages of cloud-optimised formats like Zarr.
Now, it is time to discover which data products will be available and where you can access them.

### What we will learn

- 💾 What Sentinel data will be available as EOPF Zarr products?
- 🛰️ A sneak peek into where you can access EOPF Zarr products


<hr>

## Available EOPF Zarr products
Re-engineered EOPF Zarr products are available for exploration via the [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service STAC Catalog](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/?.language=en).
Data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions are being reprocessed and made available.

::: {.callout-important}
The re-processing from the Sentinel missions is an ongoing activity as part of the [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/). This page and our tutorials will continuously be updated as soon as new data products are available.
:::

An overview of the datasets that are being re-engineered for different processing levels is given below.

### Sentinel-1
Sentinel-1 is a radar imaging mission that is composed of a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites providing continuous all-weather, day and night imagery.

| Product | Instrument | Description | Available at |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Level-1 GRD| Ground Range Detected | The Sentinel-1 Level-1 GRD products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using the Earth ellipsoid model WGS84. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l1-grd?.language=en) |
| Level-1 SLC | Single Look Complex ( | The Sentinel-1 Level-1 SLC products consist of focused SAR data, geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite, and provided in slant-range geometry. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l1-slc?.language=en) |
| Level-2 OCN | Ocean | The Sentinel-1 Level-2 OCN products for wind, wave and currents applications may contain the following geophysical components derived from the SAR data: Ocean Wind field (OWI), Ocean Swell spectra (OSW), Surface Radial Velocity (RVL). | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l2-ocn?.language=en) |


### Sentinel-2 
Sentinel-2 acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolution (10m to 60m) over land and coastal waters. The mission supports applications such as agricultural monitoring, emergency management, land cover classifications, and water quality.

| Product | Instrument | Description | Available at |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Level-1C | Multi-Spectral Instrument | The Sentinel-2 Level-1C product is composed of 110x110 km2 tiles (ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection). Earth is subdivided into a predefined set of tiles, defined in UTM/WGS84 projection and using a 100 km step. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-2-l1c) |
| Level-2A | Multi-Spectral Instrument | The Sentinel-2 Level-2A Collection 1 product provides orthorectified Surface Reflectance (Bottom-Of-Atmosphere: BOA), with sub-pixel multispectral and multitemporal registration accuracy. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-2-l2a) |

### Sentinel-3

Sentinel-3 is a mission that regularly measures our Earth's oceans, land, rivers, lakes, ice on land, sea ice, and the atmosphere. Its goal is to keep track of and help us understand how these large parts of our planet change over long periods.

#### Ocean and Land Colour Instrument

## Conclusion

In this section, we provide an overview of the available **Sentinel Missions** that will be re-processed and made available as EOPF Zarr products.


## What's next?
In the following [chapter](/02_about_eopf_zarr/21_what_is_zarr.qmd), we will dive deep into `EOPF Zarr` format and understand why it can provide an optimal and efficient application.

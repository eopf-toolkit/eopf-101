## Available EOPF products
Re-engineered datasets as part of ESA's EOPF activity are available for exploration via the [EOPF Sentinel Sample Service's STAC Catalog](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/?.language=en).

At the moment data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions are being re-processed and made available.

::: {.callout-important}
The re-processing from the Sentinel Missions is an ongoing activity as part of the [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/). This page and our tutorials will continuously be updated as soon as new data products are available.
:::

An overview of the datasets that are being re-engineered for different processing levels is given below.

### Sentinel-1
Sentinel-1 is a radar imaging mission that is composed of a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites providing continuous all-weather, day and night imagery.

| Product | Instrument | Description | Available at |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Level-1 GRD| Ground Range Detected | The Sentinel-1 Level-1 GDR products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using the Earth ellipsoid model WGS84. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l1-grd?.language=en) |
| Level-1 SLC | Single Look Complex ( | The Sentinel-1 Level-1 SLC products consist of focused SAR data, geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite, and provided in slant-range geometry. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l1-slc?.language=en) |
| Level-2 OCN | Ocean | The Sentinel-1 Level-2 OCN products for wind, wave and currents applications may contain the following geophysical components derived from the SAR data: Ocean Wind field (OWI), Ocean Swell spectra (OSW), Surface Radial Velocity (RVL). | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-1-l2-ocn?.language=en) |


### Sentinel-2 
Sentinel-2 acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolution (10m to 60m) over land and coastal waters. The mission supports applications such as agricultural monitoring, emergency management, land cover classifications, and water quality.

| Product | Instrument | Description | Available at |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Level-1C | Multi-Spectral Instrument | The Sentinel-2 Level-1C product is composed of 110x110 km2 tiles (ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection). Earth is subdivided on a predefined set of tiles, defined in UTM/WGS84 projection and using a 100 km step. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-2-l1c) |
| Level-2A | Multi-Spectral Instrument | The Sentinel-2 Level-2A Collection 1 product provides orthorectified Surface Reflectance (Bottom-Of-Atmosphere: BOA), with sub-pixel multispectral and multitemporal registration accuracy. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-2-l2a) |

### Sentinel-3

Sentinel-3 is a mission that regularly measures our Earth's oceans, land, rivers, lakes, ice on land, sea ice, and the atmosphere. Its goal is to keep track of and help us understand how these large parts of our planet change over long periods.

#### Ocean and Land Colour Instrument

| Level-2 LST | LST: Land Surface Temperature | The Sentinel-3 SLSTR Level-2 LST product provides land surface temperature. | [this link](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-3-slstr-l2-lst) |

### What's next?
In the following chapter, we dive deeper into the advantages of the `Zarr` data format and we start with practically working with EOPF Zarr datasets.

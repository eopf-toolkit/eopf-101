    "The `.zarr` format is particularly well suited for hazard analysis because it enables multiple datasets to be combined into a single structure, either as a data cube or as a list of datatrees. This makes it ideal for rapid, multi-temporal, and multi-spatial monitoring. Unlike the `.SAFE` format, which required downloading entire products, `.zarr` only loads the specific groups needed, while the rest is accessed on the fly. As a result, both data handling and subsequent operations are much faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the ecosystem for `.zarr` is still evolving, there are already promising developments. In the past, `.SAFE` products could be fully processed on applications like SNAP, but similar completeness has not yet been reached for `.zarr`. Nevertheless, libraries such as `xarray_sentinel` and are beginning to cover essential SAR operations. This potential is illustrated in the Valencia flood case study, where Sentinel-1 backscatter sensitivity to water enabled clear mapping of flood extent and duration. The same workflow can be adapted to other flood events by adjusting the relevant thresholds and parameters to match local conditions."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial has demonstrated a significant improvement to Sentinel-1 flood mapping by implementing proper GCP-based slicing and geocoding. The key improvements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Main Improvements Made:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GCP-Based Spatial Slicing**: Instead of using hardcoded index slicing, we now use Ground Control Points (GCPs) to find the appropriate geographical area, ensuring that all products cover the same ground locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Proper Geocoding**: Data is geocoded to a regular grid where each pixel represents exactly the same geographical area across all time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Aligned Time Series**: The geocoded approach enables accurate time series analysis where temporal changes reflect real changes in surface conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Benefits for Multi-Product Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geographic Consistency**: Each pixel represents the same area on the ground across all dates\n",
    "- **Accurate Change Detection**: Differences between images reflect real changes, not geometric misalignment\n",
    "- **Reliable Time Series**: Temporal analysis is geographically meaningful\n",
    "- **Operational Ready**: Suitable for automated flood monitoring systems\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Can be easily combined with other geocoded datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Technical Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved workflow follows these steps:\n",
    "1. Define bounding box around area of interest\n",
    "2. Use GCPs to find appropriate slicing indices\n",
    "3. Crop and decimate data based on geographic bounds\n",
    "4. Interpolate GCPs to match processed data\n",
    "5. Geocode all products to a common regular grid\n",
    "6. Create aligned time series for accurate analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach transforms the notebook from a single-product demonstration to a robust multi-product flood monitoring system suitable for operational use."

    "- Backscatter Computation Libraries: There are only a few working Python libraries that handle backscatter computation. When considering the `.zarr` format, the list becomes even smaller. `xarray_sentinel` is a very good library that handles intensity backscatter computation with `.zarr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Terrain Correction: With the available libraries, it is very difficult to perform geometric and radiometric terrain correction. The existing tools that support the .`zarr` format are not yet fully operational and do not accept the format as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image Coregistration: As discussed previously, the .`zarr` format is perfect for handling multiple datasets simultaneously and, thus, for time series analysis. The problem is that there is no library or package that performs proper **coregistration** of Sentinel images, especially with the `.zarr` format. In this tutorial, we used a simplified coordinate assignment approach rather than true coregistration, which works for our specific use case but has limitations. Proper coregistration remains a significant challenge because it is an important step for most production SAR workflows."

    "The `.zarr` format is particularly well suited for hazard analysis because it enables multiple datasets to be combined into a single structure, either as a data cube or as a list of datatrees. This makes it ideal for rapid, multi-temporal, and multi-spatial monitoring. Unlike the `.SAFE` format, which required downloading entire products, `.zarr` only loads the specific groups needed, while the rest is accessed on the fly. As a result, both data handling and subsequent operations are much faster and more efficient.\n",

    "Although the ecosystem for `.zarr` is still evolving, there are already promising developments. In the past, `.SAFE` products could be fully processed on applications like SNAP, but similar completeness has not yet been reached for `.zarr`. Nevertheless, libraries such as `xarray_sentinel` and are beginning to cover essential SAR operations. This potential is illustrated in the Valencia flood case study, where Sentinel-1 backscatter sensitivity to water enabled clear mapping of flood extent and duration. The same workflow can be adapted to other flood events by adjusting the relevant thresholds and parameters to match local conditions."
